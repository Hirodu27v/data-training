# NYT Data Training Materials
Materials from the NYT data training program, available for public use. 

For some background on what is in these files, please read the blog post [here](https://open.nytimes.com/how-we-helped-our-reporters-learn-to-love-spreadsheets-adc43a93b919).

We recommend you view these files through [Google Drive here.](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1ZS57_40tWuIB7tV4APVMmTZ-5PXDwX9w?usp=sharing) The activities and cheat sheets all follow Google Sheets. 

We're providing the materials on Github as well because of requests to translate the materials. If you're interested in helping, please reach out and let us know. We are happy to connect you with anyone in your language who has already contacted us. 

If you're not familiar with Github and would like to help, here is a suggested workflow: 
* Click the green “clone or download” button and download a ZIP of these files to your computer
* Above that, press fork in the top right, which will create a copy of these files in your own Github account
* You can edit directly in the files to translate them via Microsoft Word and Excel, as necessary after you unzip the folder you downloaded to your computer
* Create a folder for your language on your computer and store translated files inside (preferably in the same file structure we use) 
* When you are ready to upload a new file or folder back to Github, go to the copy of data-training in your own Github account, hit “upload files” and drag your language folder and the translated files inside into Github. Scroll down and type a message and hit the green commit button. 
* When you are ready to integrate your changes with ours, hit “new pull request” from data-training page on your Github account. Then, create pull request.
